The Great tutorial series
  Example Files

In this directory, you'll find all the starting points and support files you'll need for this section of your Great tutorial course. You should have these files available for use before you begin this section, as we'll use these files liberally in the lessons.

The example files are meant to help you along, not do your work for you. We believe the best learning comes from doing. While we provide completed example files for each section (check out the completed/ directory), those files are best used to check your work or to help you out of a jam.

We welcome your feedback. You can always reach us online at http://www.oreilly.com/go/great or on Twitter at @oreillyvideo. Enjoy!
